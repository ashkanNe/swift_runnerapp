Steven and Ashkan were assigned a project to make a beneficial application and they were wondering for who and for what they should make their application. They realized that many coaches for cross country have trouble efficiently recording their teams data and making sure that their team is progressing during their season. After a while of brainstorming, they decided to make their application for their school’s cross country team. The application was going to record the run times of the runners and store the data for the coach to see. They began making it but then Steven moved to Mississippi for about a month and a half leaving both of them wondering what they should do. They decided that working on it together over long distance was the best thing to do. We made the application over the course of our Fall school semester. They even did a Pecha Kucha presentation explaining their “crisis” and how they fixed it to make the application. They hope that even if they do not win, their application could be efficient for some other person.
